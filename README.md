Ensong aims to be the last music reviewing site you'll ever need. We combine the largest and most accurate music database available with a modern interface to make ourselves the best possible site for rating and reviewing music.

**Features:**

- ðŸ“š Backed by [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/), our library contains hundreds of thousands of songs, albums, artists, and more. MusicBrainz is one of the most reliable and accurate music databases out there.
- ðŸŒ± Unlike some of our competitors, Ensong doesn't have a user interface that looks straight out of 2005. Our simplistic UI is designed to easily usable and accessible for everyone.
- ðŸ’¸ Ensong is completely free and open source, and always will be. Developed entirely by members of our community, the entire source code is also available on Github.
