## Running the Codebase

Ensong is based on [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django). You must have Docker installed to run or develop Ensong as all the tools used are included in a Docker Compose image, including PostgreSQL, Mailhog, Celery/Flower, and Redis.

```
$ docker-compose up -d --build
$ docker-compose -f local.yml run python manage.py migrate
$ docker-compose -f local.yml run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Additionally, if you are not completely proficient in the Docker CLI it is useful to install Docker Desktop to view your images and their console outputs.

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ docker-compose -f local.yml run python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run django mypy ensong

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html#sass-compilation-live-reloading).

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment-with-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`

## Deployment

The following details how to deploy this application.
